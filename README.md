Data scientists visualize data to understand it better. This can mean looking at the raw data, summary measures such as averages, or graphing the data. Graphs are a powerful means of viewing data, as we can discern moderately complex patterns quickly without needing to define mathematical summary measures.

epresenting data visually typically means graphing it. This is done to provide a fast qualitative assessment of our data, which can be useful for understanding results, finding outlier values, understanding how numbers are distributed, and so on.

While sometimes we know ahead of time what kind of graph will be most useful, other times we use graphs in an exploratory way. 

Graphs aren't limited to 2D scatter plots like those above, but can be used to explore other kinds of data, like proportions - shown through pie charts, stacked bar graphs - how data are spread - with histograms, box and whisker plots - and how two data sets differ. Often, when we're trying to understand raw data or results, we may experiment with different types of graphs until we come across one that explains the data in a visually intuitive way
